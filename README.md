## Decorator Pattern
The decorator pattern allows to dynamically (Runtime) "decorate" the behavior of an object
without affecting the behavior of other projects from the same class.
New classed must implement the Interface (aka Contract)
that describes the basic behavior.

Pros: Respects the SOLID principles especially the opened/closed one: 
"Software entities must be open for extension, but close for modification"
